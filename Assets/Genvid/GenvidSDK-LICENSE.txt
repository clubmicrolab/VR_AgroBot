2. LICENSE
2.1. Licenses. Subject to Section 2.2 and the other terms and conditions of this License, Genvid grants 
the following licenses to Licensee:
(a) Installation: a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited royalty-free license to reproduce and install 
the Genvid SDK on Licensee computers and workstations and use the Genvid SDK for the incorporation 
and integration of the Genvid SDK into Licensee Products.
(b) Evaluation and Testing Purposes: a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited royalty-free license to (i) 
use the Genvid SDK to produce Licensee Products, (ii) integrate and incorporate the server components

connect to Interactive Streams produced by Licensee, but solely for evaluation and testing purposes. 
Once Licensee produces Interactive Streams for purposes other than evaluation and testing, including 
once Licensee derives revenue from Interactive Streams in connection with a specific Licensee Product, 
the right and license granted pursuant to this paragraph 2.1(b) in connection with such Licensee Product 
will automatically terminate; and
(c) Public Broadcast of Interactive Streams: subject to Licensee’s compliance with the provisions of 
Section 3, a non-exclusive, non-transferable, and limited license to (i) use the Genvid SDK to produce the 
Commercially-Licensed Product; (ii) integrate and incorporate the server components of the Genvid SDK 
into the Commercially-Licensed Product, (iii) use and run the Commercially-Licensed Product to produce 
and broadcast Interactive Streams, and (iii) use, reproduce, publicly perform, display, and distribute, 
make available for downloading and make available for access the client components of the Genvid SDK 
to allow viewers to connect to Interactive Streams produced by Licensee. Licensee will notify Genvid of 
its planned commercial use of the Genvid SDK in connection with a Commercially-Licensed Product by 
contacting Genvid at info@genvidtech.com at least 15 days prior to the first public broadcast of an 
Interactive Stream for the Commercially-Licensed Product.
2.2. Restrictions. Licensee may not
(a) use the Genvid SDK (i) to develop software, products or services that: (A) constitute, promote or is 
used primarily for activities which are illegal, violate the rights of third parties, are fraudulent or 
misleading, (B) could harm the name or reputation of Genvid, or (C) which could harm, modify or 
misappropriate software or data on an end user’s computer, including but not limited to spyware, or 
other malicious programs or code, the distribution of unsolicited email (“spam”), multi-level marketing 
proposals, hate materials, or containing content which is libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, 
abusive or otherwise offensive (ii) in support of a claim by you or any third party that the Licensed 
Technology infringes a patent.
(b) reproduce, copy, distribute, sublicense, make available, display, disclose or use the Genvid SDK or 
any components of the Genvid SDK in any manner not expressly authorized in this License. Licensee may 
not reverse engineer, reverse compile or otherwise attempt to reveal or access source code to the 
Genvid SDK (except to the extent already visible in source code form in the Genvid SDK). The restriction 
against reverse engineering, reverse compilation or other measure to access source code set out in the 
preceding sentence does not apply to the “Gvencode” executable of the Licensed Technology, which 
comprises the following files from the distribution package: bin/gvencode.exe, images/gvencode_*.zip. 
For clarity, the restrictions against unauthorized reproduction, copy, distribution, display, disclosure, etc. 
set out in the first sentence of this paragraph 2.2(b) still apply to the “Gvencode” executable.
(c) copy the Genvid SDK, Licensee Products or Commercially-Licensed Products onto any public or 
distributed network.
(d) use the Genvid SDK to operate in or as a time-sharing, outsourcing, service bureau, application 
service provider or managed service provider environment.
(e) use the Genvid SDK or any of its components as a standalone application or any other purpose than

(f) remove or alter any trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or 
labels in the Genvid SDK;
(g) modify the Genvid SDK.
(h) release any Licensee Product pursuant to any “copyleft” or “community source” license, including 
but not limited to the GNU General Public License, Lesser General Public License or similar license 
arrangement in a manner that would require (or purport to require) the distribution, license, or 
disclosure of the source code of the software being licensed or derivative works thereof.

(i) use the Genvid SDK in any type of a system or application in which the failure of the software or 
hardware could create a situation where personal injury or death may occur (e.g., medical systems, life 
sustaining or lifesaving systems). Should Licensee use the Genvid SDK for any such unintended or 
unauthorized use, Licensee hereby agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold Genvid and its officers, 
employees and affiliates harmless against all claims, costs, damages, expenses, and reasonable attorney 
fees arising out of, directly or indirectly, such use and any claim of product liability, personal injury or 
death associated with such unintended or unauthorized use, even if such claim alleges that Genvid was 
negligent regarding the design or development of the Genvid SDK.
2.3. Updates and Upgrades. Genvid may release updates or upgrades to the Genvid SDK from time to 
time and such updates and upgrades will be governed by this License, unless Genvid makes access to 
such updates or upgrades subject to entering into a new agreement.

3. COMMERCIAL USE OF GENVID SDK
3.1. Commercially-Licensed Product. Should Licensee’s use of the Genvid SDK be made pursuant to 
Section 2.1(c), all references to Licensee Products in this License will be meant to be references to the 
specific Commercially-Licensed Product.
3.2. Restrictions. Should Licensee’s use of the Genvid SDK be made pursuant to Section 2.1(c), the 
License does not allow for stream-based transactions such as Game Items or Viewer Items Purchases, 
unless Licensee executes a Supplementary Commercial License by contacting Genvid at 
info@genvidtech.com.
3.3. Royalties.
(a) In consideration for the grant of a license to use the Genvid SDK for commercial purposes pursuant 
to Section 2.1(c), Licensee agrees to pay to Genvid a USD$0.07 fee per Unique Monthly Viewer (the 
“Royalties”) for each Interactive Stream generated by its Commercially-Licensed Product(s).
(b) The amount of Royalties is exclusive of all taxes, assessments, tariffs, duties or other fees imposed, 
assessed or collected by or under the authority of any governmental body (collectively, “Taxes”) and 
Licensee is solely responsible for the payment of all such Taxes, arising from Genvid’s provision of the 
License hereunder and Licensee’s payment of the Royalties, except any taxes assessed on Genvid’s net 
income. If Genvid is required to directly pay Taxes related to Licensee’s use of the Genvid SDK 
hereunder, Licensee agrees to promptly reimburse Genvid for any amounts paid by Genvid.
3.4. Tracking and Reporting. Licensee is responsible for tracking and reporting on a monthly basis 
Unique Monthly Viewers of the Interactive Streams for its Commercially-Licensed Product(s). Licensee 
will deploy and maintain a tracking mechanism acceptable to Genvid to account for and report the 
number of Unique Monthly Viewers as well as the following reporting metrics: average viewing time, 
total hours streamed and peak concurrent viewers. Such tracking mechanism should provide 
comprehensive logging capability to allow an audit of reported Unique Monthly Viewers. In addition to 
monthly reporting associated with the payment of Royalties as set out in Section 3.5(a), Licensee will 
also provide up-to-date reports to Genvid at any time upon demand.

3.5. Payment of Royalties.
(a) Licensee will produce the activity reports referenced in Section 3.4 and pay the associated Royalties 
within 30 days from the end of a month. Licensee will produce activity reports even when the amount of 
Royalties owed during a month is nil. Once monthly Royalties payable by Licensee reach $1,000, 
Licensee will pay in advance each month 25% of the average monthly Royalties for the preceding 3 
months. The difference between the amount of Royalties actually due by Licensee for a month and the 
amount invoiced in advance for such month will be paid upon presentation of the activity report for 
such month.
(b) If Genvid does not receive Royalties by the due date, then at Genvid’s discretion, (i) such charges 
may accrue late interest at the rate of 15% per annum, calculated on a monthly basis on the outstanding 
balance, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, from the date such payment was 
due until the date paid.
(c) Except to the extent required by law, all payments, fees and Royalties are non-refundable, regardless 
of whether or not this License has been terminated.
3.6. Adjustment of Rate of Royalties. Genvid may from time to time but not more than once per 12-
month period notify Licensee of a modification of the rates of Royalties at least 90 days prior to such 
modification becoming effective. Should Licensee oppose such modification, Licensee will then cease to 
use the Genvid SDK for commercial purposes pursuant to Section 2.1(c).
